[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> 
# Problem  
Exercise 2.4 Using the variable 'totalwgt_lb', investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

# Answer  
Based on the statistics below first and other babies are born with only marginally different weight from each other. The difference in pounds is 0.12, with heavier babies being slightly more present among 'first' ones, however when compared to the standard deviance using Cohen d, the difference in means only translates to 0.09 standard deviations. This is slightly higher than for the lenghts of the pregnancy but still seems very small.

# Python code
```python
mean = live.totalwgt_lb.mean()
var = live.totalwgt_lb.var()
std = live.totalwgt_lb.std()

print('Live mean', mean)
print('Live variance', var)
print('Live std', std)

mean1 = firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean()
mean2 = others.totalwgt_lb.mean()

print('First babies', mean1)

print('First babies', var1)
print('Others', var2)

print('Difference in pounds', mean1 - mean2)
print('Difference in gramms', (mean1 - mean2) * 453.592)
